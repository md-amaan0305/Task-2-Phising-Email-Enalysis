The sender domain "paypa1-secure.com" closely resembles the legitimate PayPal domain but contains a typo, indicating email spoofing.

### 2. Urgent and Threatening Language
The email pressures the user to act within 24 hours, which is a common phishing tactic to create panic.

## Security Risks
- Credential theft
